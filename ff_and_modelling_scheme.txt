SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
======================

This version of Protean must support modifications including:
	1) phosphorylated amino acids
	2) methylated amino acids
	3) acetylated amino acids
	
To support regions of flexible length, we must use modeller to build models. Thus, we may
have to simply mutate to base amino acid, prior to modification, then patch model after modeller
generates loops. Also, keep in mind that homology modelling will discard hydrogens, so we need
to add them in, and correctly apply patches each time.

I want to avoid keeping track of structural information outside of topology files. So I need to
rewrite current code to an appropriate mutator strategy.
	
Main complication: while structural information can be archived in topology files, insertion regions
are dynamic. I can recalculate postions given some initial reference structure with defined
insertion/deletion regions, but this requires more cpu tasks. I could also add a variable to keep
track of changes in insertion/deletion regions, but this requires more disk space. I think second
approach (using disk space) is better and more robust, especially when considering how non-standard
amino acids or modified amino acids must be supported.

MAIN SOFTWARE COMPONENTS
========================

Protean requires the following methods:
	1) Energy minimization (constant energy)							Done
	2) Energy optimization (NPT) - simulated annealing					Done
	3) Model preparation - add hydrogens, homology modelling			Done		
	4) Structure editing - mutate residues, insert/delete residues		Done
	5) Evolution scheduler - randomly edit structure within				----
		some constraints

BRAINSTORMING
=============

If simulated annealing approach is not robust enough, which I suspect is the case, then perhaps
I can run implicit solvent MD on each structure until energy variance within the last time window
is below a certain threshold. Acceptance/rejection criteria can be determines by average energy
within this time window. It is possible this will even be faster than the alternative approach.
